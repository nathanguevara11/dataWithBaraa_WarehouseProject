Data Warehouse Project! 
--this project is part of DataWithBaraa's 30 hour SQL video using SQL Sever, which I have adapted to work in Postgresql.  
--This project was structured where there would be three schemas to denote layers in the data base (bronze, silver , gold). This was a way to purify the data in stages so that once we got the gold layer we would have organized and structured data to use for exploratory data analysis. In this readme we will provide a brief description of what was done in each layer. 

The Bronze Layer 
--The bronze layer is where we created the database and schemas, handled tables, and did some basic cleaning on the data so that it could be transported to the silver layer.
--The silver layer involved cleaning and repackaging the data. We removed duplicates, trimmed strings, used case statements to clean our data, etc.
